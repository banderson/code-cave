### How it works

Pick how long you want to be in "code cave" mode and it:
- sets you as dnd for that duration
- sets your slack status to code cave mode
- creates an event and blocks your calendar
- toggles your mac's dnd for all notifications
- resets everything when the time elapses and you "emerge" from the cave
- makes you a better programmer (j/k only using rxjava makes you a better programmer)

### Setup

- Install the latest node version. I used `$ nvm install v9.3.0`.
- Run yarn `$ yarn install`.
- Symlink this package `$ yarn link` (from within the `code-cave` directory)
- Set up your default status: `$ codecave defaults`
- Set up your slack and google cal creds: `$ codecave config`

You are probably good to go!

### Usage

`codecave enter` - enter the cave, after N minutes you will exit automagically

`codecave emerge` - exit the cave and come back to this dull and boring world

### Warning

This is a super alpha version. It is very likely not going to work for you. Proceed with caution.

If you have questions ping me @gbanis on slack. I'll get back to you when I emerge from the cave. ðŸ˜„
